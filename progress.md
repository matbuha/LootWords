Original prompt: Build LootWords as a browser-based children's word-learning game in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with two internal mini-games, reward boxes that open in exactly three taps, collectible noun cards with persisted random points and rarity, localStorage persistence, modular architecture, and a phase-by-phase checklist that stays updated.

## Work Log

- 2026-03-30: Read the repo baseline and loaded the local frontend/game workflow skills.
- 2026-03-30: Created the requested directory structure under `lootwords/`.
- 2026-03-30: Implemented the SPA shell, route handling, localStorage profile normalization, and modular screen/game architecture.
- 2026-03-30: Added a 70-card noun dataset with persisted point values, rarity tiers, reward logic, and placeholder art based on icon glyphs.
- 2026-03-30: Built Memory Match and Treasure Match, then connected wins to reward-box inventory and progression.
- 2026-03-30: Verified in-browser flows with Playwright:
  - Memory Match win -> reward box earned -> 3-tap reward reveal -> collection + learn + reload persistence.
  - Treasure Match win -> reward box earned.
  - Second reward reveal unlocked a different card, confirming duplicate prevention.
  - Collection filters persisted.
  - "All cards collected" fallback converted a reward box into 50 bonus stars.
  - Final browser refresh completed with zero console errors.

## Notes

- MVP card art uses embedded icon-based placeholders so the app is playable before custom images are added.
- The browser verification used a local static server at `http://127.0.0.1:8123/lootwords/`.
